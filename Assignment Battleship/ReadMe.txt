Controls: click on squares to sink ships

Note: This was not the final submission because it lacks the inline commenting, in the beginning I was writing comments in a different document I no longer have and the school has since taken down my final submission from their servers.

Ships in this version apear to be only one block big and two have been highlighted for testing reasons.
